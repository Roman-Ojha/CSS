/* if one element is style by more than one rule,which style will be aplicable */
/*


example:

html:
----------
<div>
<p class="red-p">Text..... </p>
</div>

CSS:
-----------
p{
    color:green;
}
.red-p{
    color:red;
}
div.red-p{
    color:blue;
}

we are targating the same element by different selector 
now spacificity rule will decide which selector value will apply to the 
element .
more spacific rule will get more value.

more spacific means in how much detail that selector defain the element 

GENERAL RULE:
* !important will override every thing
* inline can override everything except !important
* External will work according to specificity

Specificity Rules:
* (#) ID selector has higher value
* (*) univarsal selector has lower value

Specificity Rule Trick (point System)
* 10,000 point to !important
* 1000 to inline
* 100 to id
* 10 to class,attribute or pseudo-calss
* 1 for element selector & pseudo elements
* 0 to univarsal selector

ex:

(1 point) p{
    color:green;
}
(10 point) .red-p{
    color:red;
}
(10+1 point) div.red-p{
    color:blue;
}

therefore div.red-p have more value that's why div.red-p selector value will apply
to the element

NOTE: if same rule written two or more times in external sheet then last rule 
will be app;icable
